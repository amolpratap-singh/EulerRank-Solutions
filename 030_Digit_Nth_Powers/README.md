[Project Euler #30: Digit Nth Powers](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler030/problem)

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

$1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4$ <br>
$8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4$ <br>
$9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4$ <br>

As $1 = 1^4$ is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is $1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316$.
Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
