[Project Euler #25: 1000 Digit Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler025/problem)

<p>The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:</p>

$F_n$ = $F_{n - 1}$ + $F_{n - 2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.

Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

$F_1 = 1$ <br>
$F_2 = 1$ <br>
$F_3 = 2$ <br>
$F_4 = 3$ <br>
$F_5 = 5$ <br>
$F_6 = 8$ <br>
$F_7 = 13$ <br>
$F_8 = 21$ <br>
$F_9 = 34$ <br>
$F_{10} = 55$ <br>
$F_{11} = 89$ <br>
$F_{12} = 144$ <br>

The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?
