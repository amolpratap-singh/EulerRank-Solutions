[Project Euler #102: Triangle Containment](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler102/problem)

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which $-1000 \le x, y \le 1000$, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)<br>
X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)


It can be verified that triangle $ABC$ contains the origin, whereas triangle $XYZ$ does not.

Using <a href="resources/documents/0102_triangles.txt">triangles.txt</a> (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

<p class="smaller">NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.</p>
